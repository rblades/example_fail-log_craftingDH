# Week 2 fail log
A better time with eyesight and thereby with working on the computer but still not enough sustained time to work on this.

## Annotation
Annotation work went much better, particularly with respect to finding and commenting on other people's comments, although there seem to be rather a small number of commentators from what I expected with a class list of 53. Why after 6 years of TAing I would be surprised at this, is perhaps the real mystery. On the other hand I keep forgetting to tag with the group name. Due to working within the group environment, I don't think I need it when I'm doing it. I admit I also am undigital and do not think about tags.

My first annotation commented on the overall subject of this module which I admit I did not find compelling (https://hyp.is/S2Jh2HpEEemla8eO1iwnFA/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Exercises/). I am unlikely to be involved in a collaborative project in my current life and I have no problems making Word work--although I do curse it constantly as a cumbersome tool that does neither word processing nor text layout well. Wordperfect was better as a tool but was outsold and died. On the other hand I read your exchange with Jeff Blackadar from 2 years ago on the value of Mark-up. He is a pal of mine so I think I'll suggest coffee to him and actually talk it through. The problem of proprietary software is only partially solved by turning things into pdf's or even pdf/A (which is a problem of course in and of itself since Apple does not support this - as I found in the nightmare of trying to submit my signed-off diss)

## Second and Third Annotation
Trevor Owens raises good points about the value of being able to link through to primary documents as footnote, points which I supported. (https://hyp.is/dta9BHpFEemupU8rW7KIQw/www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/). Elsewhere, on one of Ian Milligan's posts talking about SSHERC, I commented that I did not really want to rely on academics photographing a fonds for me because they will be asking their own question which may direct what they find worth photographing in a fonds different from me (https://hyp.is/vf8x8npPEemD4XNIRRfdzw/ianmilligan.ca/2014/10/23/sshrcs-research-data-archiving-policy-and-historians/) This expresses some of my problem with digital history claims. Owens as a librarian thinks about sharing information and says it is a Good Thing and he is right. Milligan points out that we are in fact supposed to deposit our research and this will be a Good Think when we historians actually do it - and that the librarians don't understand why we don't. But historians are not librarians or archivists whose job is to disseminate uninterpreted material. Our job is to take material and think about it within the framework of a question, or something puzzling us. Footnotes with links then will give me insight into the historian's argument in that it will make his/her sources transparent. But I would not want to trust that he/she looked at or made a copy of all the documents in a fonds.


## Comments and Concerns
One problem I am finding is that I end up with multiple pages open and it becomes very confusing. If I was rich I think I would get multiple computers and work on one central computer. I am not so I continue to waste time trying to find the right document.

I also realize the way I have learned computing since the first desktop I had access to (back I think in the 1980s when work always started with DOS command) is holding me up. I have never taken a course in anything to do with computers. I just find out how to open it up and then I hit things until I get what I want. I repeat the things that worked and avoid the things that don't. It's a slow process which is not suited to a 6-week course but I am too impatient to go step by step following instructions. But it took its toll this week for I only got through exercise 1. Given that the notes show I will have to use the DH box I set up last week and that I have to do more with Git - I will be doing double duty this week.

I set up Slack last week and some emails were pushed through to my Carleton account but I seem to have lost it - at least my bookmark for it isn't going anywhere useful. Another thing to fix.

But I am looking forward to module 2 which is very much what I have wanted to learn about.
