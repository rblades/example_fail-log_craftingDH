Week 3 and I need a restart. Taking a 6 week course was a mistake as I am not having time to assimilate information. My normal modus is to work through something badly and then, and only then, I can understand the directions and do it right.
Happily I have now re-found my bookmark to Slack so things are better there.

(Monday) # Started the Restart by reviewing module 1
Reread the module 1 text and checked out the videos. Everything is up and running as directed. I still have problems finding the working space in Git and particular these repositories. I think the problem is that the explanation in the workbook did not give me a visual sense of what these are or where they are.
Googled <what are Git repositories>. Got Wikipedia explaining its a programming tool. Also Understanding Git: Repositories - sbf5.com
https://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git/git-1.shtml Am trying out its instructions to initiate a project which will hold the repositories. I notice the website's example commands look like terminal eg mkdir [project] / cd {change directory if I recall right} [project] / git init. I'll start by clicking directory
Next job is printing out some of the reading material for module 3 - can only read so much on-line.
