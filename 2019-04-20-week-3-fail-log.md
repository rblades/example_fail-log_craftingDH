Week 3 and I need a restart. Taking a 6 week course was a mistake as I am not having time to assimilate information. My normal modus is to work through something badly and then, and only then, I can understand the directions and do it right.
Happily I have now re-found my bookmark to Slack so things are better there.

(Monday) # Started the Restart by reviewing module 1
Reread the module 1 text and checked out the videos. Everything is up and running as directed. I still have problems finding the working space in Git and particular these repositories. I think the problem is that the explanation in the workbook did not give me a visual sense of what these are or where they are.

Googled <what are Git repositories>. Got Wikipedia explaining its a programming tool. Also Understanding Git: Repositories - sbf5.com
https://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git/git-1.shtml Am trying out its instructions to initiate a project which will hold the repositories. I notice the website's example commands look like terminal eg mkdir [project] / cd {change directory if I recall right} [project] / git init. I'll start by clicking directory
Created a new project "Work for DH Summer 2019". It appears to be a simple took for project planning. I have worked with many such beasts and never found them all that useful but I am almost always working alone. I added 3 columns (Module - Exercise - Blog). Checked out the menu box and saw I could close it and I could see a list of what I had done. Random typing of <git init> pointless. Tried to see how I could put in code as per the sbf5 site but didn't find anything. Closed the project and found it effectively disappeared so that I showed 0 projects. Got the list showing it and went in an deleted it.
  
I see I went wrong by not hitting create new file. I would like to bring my module 2 fail-log and this fail-lot out from under "patch 2" so they are visible in the repository list. Will start here by copying this material and then going back to the repository to get a new file there.

Next job is printing out some of the reading material for module 3 - can only read so much on-line.
