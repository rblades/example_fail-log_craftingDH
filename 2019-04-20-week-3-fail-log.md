Week 3 and I need a restart. Taking a 6 week course was a mistake as I am not having time to assimilate information. My normal modus is to work through something badly and then, and only then, I can understand the directions and do it right.
Happily I have now re-found my bookmark to Slack so things are better there.

(Monday) # Started the Restart by reviewing module 1
Reread the module 1 text and checked out the videos. Everything is up and running as directed. I still have problems finding the working space in Git and particular these repositories.
Next job is printing out some of the reading material for module 3 - can only read so much on-line.
